1	Logic : relation of consequence between the premises and the conclusion of sound argument

1.1	Sound(an argument): if conclusion is a consequence of its premises ~ correct, valid

1.2	Unsound : not Sound

1.3	Argument : System of declarative sentences

1.3.1	Conclusion

1.3.2	Premises

1.3.3	Sentences : linguistic expression stating a complete thought

1.3.3.1	Declarative

1.3.3.2	Interrogative

1.3.3.3	Imperative

1.4	Criterion for the soundness of an argument : An argument is sound iff it is not possible for its premises to be true and its conclusion false

1.4.1	Necessary truth : a Sentence is necessary truth iff no conceivable circumstances of being false

1.4.2	Conditional, consequent : If (corresponding conditional) then (consequent)

1.4.3	A sentence is a necessary truth iff no unsound argument of which it is the conclusion

1.5	Parenthetical remark 

1.5.1	If a sentence is known to be true, it is true,

1.5.1.1	Even if a sentence is true, it could not be known to be true.

1.5.2	Logically possible (a sentence) : the hypothesis it occurs is compatible with the laws of logic

1.5.3	Proposition, statement, thought, judgement

1.6	Logical form

1.6.1	If a sentence is necessary truth then all sentences of the same logical form are also necessarily true.

1.6.2	A truth of logic ( a sentence) iff it is a substitution-instance of a matrix all instances of which are necessary truths

1.6.2.1	Matrix : formal expressions built with logical words together with sentential, class, or individual letters

1.6.2.1.1	Logical words : and, or, ifâ€¦then, not, all, is, etc

1.6.2.1.2	Sentential letters : sentence

1.6.2.1.3	Class letters : a set of elements

1.6.2.1.4	Individual letters : elements

1.7	Artificial language (Formalized language) : grammatically simpler, regular than natural language
